Barney: My Rails Template
-------------------------

This template is inspired in [Florent's rails_blank_app](https://github.com/Florent2/rails_blank_app).

How to Use:
===========

    $ git clone git@github.com:frodsan/barney YourAppName
    $ YourAppName/init.sh

This is shit but you need to make sure that the given app name is CamelCased. When
the script ends, it underscores the dir name (`your_app_name`) and removes the
`init.sh` file.

Customizations:
===============

See [README_APP](https://github.com/frodsan/barney/blob/master/README_APP.md) for more information.

Famous Last Words:
==================

It's gonna be ...
